Noto is a Chrome extension that lets you leave and share notes on any website.

We developed the app to enable web developers to leave comments and record actions on sites theyâ€™re working on and have seamless discussions with various stakeholders, from design to marketing. The Noto extension lets users mark up any page virtually as they would with physical Post-its, plus replay and record screen actions to demo features and states.

On top of being a highly useful work collaboration tool, virtual Post-its create a new personal messaging medium where you can leave notes around the internet for friends to discover serendipitously. Noto brings an element of surprise and delight to your daily web browsing.
